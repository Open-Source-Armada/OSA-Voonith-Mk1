# OSA-Voonith-Mk1
Ultra lite single railgun micro fighter, for skirmishing and jousting practice.

Made for speed and fun, the Voonith is a tiny micro fighter that can swarm larger ships with hit and run jousts, its railgun means it is always a threat to larger ships, while its speed and acceleration makes it an unideal target for other enemy fighters.

//Specs//

1 railgun with a 7 second fire rate.

Shoot_1+ is your trigger, bind this to your weapon hotkey (space by default).

Sensitivity settings are adjustable from a yolo chip located at the back of the ship, this chip only adjusts your sense settings and is not vital to the operation of the aim system, you can use the U-tool save feature to save your sense settings to the ship post print.

CenterSensePlus is your standard sensitivity, Adjust to your preferred flying sensitivity.

AimMax- and AimMin- is your Aim hotkey, Bind both to the same keybind, this will lower your sensitivity, Adjust MinSensePlus to change Aim sensitivity.

AimMax+ and AimMin+ is your Boost hotkey, Bind both to the same hotkey, this will raise your sensitivity, Adjust MaxSensePlus to change Boost sensitivity.

Ship is set to both fly and aim at a smooth sensitivity (tune to your taste), Aim keybind lowers the limits for sniping, Boost keybind removes these limits allowing for faster pitch/yaw.

Armoured lightly using known methods of meta plating, including big plate health, voxel armour, segmented and layered plating and plasma/rail sacrifice plates.

Materials and components are on the high end, i leave it to the user to reduces cost to your tastes.

//Design//

Designed to hit a very low weight limit of 400 tons to preserve as much acceleration and speed, the Voonith is a perfect ship for pilots to start practicing and employing railgun jousting without the large cost of other such fighters.

Only armoured where it needs to be to save weight, it has a tiny profile and voxel armour to survive hits when jousting and remain a hard to hit target.

Armour is a mix of Dal, Char and Ymr.

The gens have enough power to charge a shot every 7 seconds, making it a joust only ship, circle fighting is not recommended.

2 prop tanks grant this ship fantastic range, making it great as a armed scout or point ship.

The vast majority of other fighters can not maintain the same speed and acceleration allowing you to pull range on any ship in a fleet fight, allowing you to safely line up you next hit and run.


//Tactics//

Railguns have always been most effective when attacking the sides and rear of ships, a small micro fighter like the Voonith can bring this powerful weapon to fleet fights in large numbers, and has the speed to deploy it quickly.

When deployed with other larger ships to support, the Voonith becomes a elusive and unideal primary target, allowing it the freedom to attack from better angles safely.

Newer pilots can support fleets with this cheap and useful weapon, without putting larger ships at risk in inexperienced hands.

Its speed and great travel range makes the Voonith an ideal fleet scout or for roaming solo, able to cover ground to reach any pvp.

The jousting strategy often drags fights out a long time, making this ship great for entangling larger ships in combat, while other friendly ships move in to gank the distracted target.

Low weight also makes this a ideal ship in the gravity of moons, where larger ships may struggle more at low altitude.
